# The `tests/al-language` submodule is read-only

`tests/al-language/` is a git submodule pinned at
[`StefanMaron/BusinessCentral.AL.Language.Tests`](https://github.com/StefanMaron/BusinessCentral.AL.Language.Tests).
It is the canonical AL-language test corpus, validated against a real BC service
tier. **Never edit any file under `tests/al-language/`.** The corpus does not
know about AL Runner and must stay that way.

## What this means in practice

- **Test failures in the corpus are runner gaps**, not corpus bugs. The
  `no-assumption-fixes` rule still applies — investigate before patching, but
  the patch always lands in the runner (or in `tests/expectations/`), never in
  the corpus.
- **`_fixtures/Assert.al`, table fixtures, helper codeunits — all off-limits.**
  If `Assert.IsNumber` excludes a type and that causes failures, the bug is
  that the runner classifies that type differently from real BC; fix the
  classification.
- **Updating the corpus** = bumping the submodule pin. Always its own PR.
  Inspect the diff first: `git -C tests/al-language diff $OLD..$NEW`.

## Out-of-scope tests use the expectations manifest

Some corpus tests exercise surfaces the runner cannot support
(report rendering, SMTP, HTTP egress, real task scheduler, …). They pass
against real BC and are expected to throw `RunnerOutOfScopeException` here.
Declare those expectations in [`tests/expectations/`](../../tests/expectations/README.md)
following the schema in [`docs/expectations.md`](../../docs/expectations.md).

Four modes:
- `expect-oos` — must raise an out-of-scope signal with a matching reason anchor,
  either a typed `RunnerOutOfScopeException` or the documented
  `out-of-scope: <api> — <reason>` message convention
- `expect-fail-known-gap` — must fail; links to an open GH issue tracking the work
- `expect-divergence` — must fail because the runner *intends* to answer
  differently from BC; carries `Reason` + `Doc`, never an `Issue`
- `skip` — must not run (last resort, for compile gaps)

Manifest drift in either direction is loud: a test that starts passing despite
an `expect-oos` entry fails the run with "remove the entry". A test that
starts throwing OOS without an entry fails with "add an entry".

## Runner-specific positive tests live elsewhere

If a test must assert runner-only behaviour (e.g. that a specific surface
throws `RunnerOutOfScopeException` with reason `email-smtp`), it goes in
`tests/runner-extras/`, not in the corpus.

The converse is a hard rule too: a test asserting plain BC behaviour may **not**
be written as a runner-local test just because that is quicker — it goes upstream
so a real service tier can adjudicate it. See
`bc-behavior-tests-go-upstream.md`.

## Sister rules

- `bc-behavior-tests-go-upstream.md` — which repo a new test belongs in, and why
- `precompiled-dll-respect.md` — what we may not rewrite in BC DLLs
- `loud-failures.md` — when to throw `RunnerOutOfScopeException`
- `no-assumption-fixes.md` — investigate before patching
- `file-issues-for-gaps.md` — gaps go to GH issues + expectation entries, never silent workarounds
