// BcCompiler.Incremental — --watch's fast path (issue #1902).
//
// Every prior --watch cycle called the SAME BcCompiler.Emit a one-shot run uses: parse every
// .al file, bind the WHOLE module, generate C# for every object, every cycle — so a one-line
// edit to one codeunit costs the same as a cold build. Measured on a 7,053-file app: 761–862s
// per save.
//
// BC's own compiler exposes the fix: Compilation.CreateForRad — the same public factory BC's
// own RAD (VS Code F5 "publish") uses. Given a change model (which objects were Added/
// Modified/Removed) and the PREVIOUS cycle's compiled symbol picture (a
// SymbolReference.ModuleDefinition — the same shape SymbolJsonWriter already produces for
// cross-app dependency resolution), it binds and generates C# for ONLY the touched objects,
// resolving everything else from the baseline instead of re-parsing/re-binding it.
//
// This file classifies every touched file into one of: content edit, add, remove, or rename
// (of the file, of the object's own AL name, or both at once) — for every object kind,
// including the six with no numeric Id (interface/controladdin/profile/pagecustomization/
// profileextension/entitlement). It falls back to the ordinary, already-correct, whole-module
// Emit() only for what genuinely cannot be proven safe: the first cycle for a bundle, an
// app.json/dependency-set change, more than one object declared in a touched file, a duplicate
// declaration only the compiler can adjudicate, or any diagnostic/exception the delta compile
// itself raises — never a stale or wrong result, just not accelerated for that cycle.
//
// Why this is safe to reuse UNCHANGED cached C# for every object that was not touched
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Confirmed by inspecting BC's own generated C# (`al-runner --dump-csharp`): a call from one AL
// object to another does NOT compile to a direct C# type reference. It compiles to
// `new NavCodeunitHandle(this, <object id>).Target.Invoke(<memberId>, args)` — an ID + a
// deterministic hash of the called procedure's name+signature, computed independently at BOTH
// the call site and the callee's own OnInvoke dispatch switch. Neither side's C# encodes the
// other's class name. So:
//   - An unmodified caller's cached C# is unaffected by ANY change to a callee's shape — it
//     dispatches by (object id, member hash) at RUNTIME, against whichever type is CURRENTLY
//     registered for that id in the SAME final assembly this cycle produces (built from the
//     UNION of every object's C# — changed objects freshly generated, everything else served
//     from the cache). It automatically sees the callee's NEW behaviour without being touched.
//   - A genuinely breaking edit (e.g. a renamed procedure an unmodified caller still calls by
//     its old name) is NOT a silent wrong answer: the caller's unchanged member-hash no longer
//     matches any case in the callee's regenerated OnInvoke switch, so the call throws
//     NavNCLMissingMethodException at the call site — loud, not silent, satisfying
//     loud-failures.md. It is also not the common case: it is a signature change to something an
//     UNMODIFIED file calls, since a MODIFIED caller would already have its own fresh call site
//     hash from the classify step below.
//   - The final union of cached + freshly-generated C# still goes through ONE ordinary Roslyn
//     C#-to-IL build and ONE ordinary module load — completely unchanged from today's full-
//     rebuild path. There is no multi-generation-assembly runtime merge anywhere in this design;
//     that is what keeps the correctness surface no larger than the existing full-rebuild path's.
//   - A REMOVED object's cached C# is dropped from the union entirely, so its runtime type is
//     simply absent from the freshly built assembly this cycle — every registry that discovers
//     AL objects by reflecting the loaded assembly (AllObj, TestExecutor discovery, subscriber
//     registries, …) naturally forgets it too, with no extra bookkeeping required here.
//
// What CreateForRad needs beyond `packagedModuleDefinition`
// -----------------------------------------------------------
// Empirically (`Compilation.CreateForRad` is undocumented outside BC's own source), passing only
// `packagedModuleDefinition` is NOT enough for the changed object to resolve a reference to an
// untouched sibling — it throws deep inside codegen with "Unexpected value 'None' of type
// NavTypeKind" (the SAME crash class BcCompiler.Emit's DotNet-resolver comment documents for an
// unresolved DotNet type, but here caused by an unresolved AL cross-object reference instead).
// The fix is to ALSO register a self-referencing ISymbolReferenceLoader/SymbolReferenceSpecification
// (same AppId/Publisher/Version as the module itself) exposing the SAME baseline objects, with
// the objects actually being changed THIS cycle excluded from it (leaving them in would raise
// "already declared" duplicate-object errors, since packagedModuleDefinition already carries
// their OLD shape). See RadSelfBaselineLoader below.
//
// Why the next baseline is a MERGE, not just "convert the RAD compilation"
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Also confirmed empirically: converting a RAD Compilation via the same SerializableSymbolModelConverter
// SymbolJsonWriter uses returns ONLY the objects that were actually source-compiled THIS cycle —
// not the untouched baseline objects pulled in via packagedModuleDefinition/the self-loader. A
// second incremental cycle chained naively off that (unmerged) module would silently forget every
// object from 2+ cycles back — exactly the kind of stale-cache bug this repo has been burned by
// before. MergeModuleDefinition below is the fix: the next baseline is (old baseline minus the
// objects just changed) UNION (freshly converted definitions for exactly those objects) — built by
// this code, never assumed from a BC API.
//
// Renames are not a distinct BC-facing case
// -------------------------------------------
// BC's ObjectChangeElement carries no file path — its own equality (decompiled and confirmed:
// ObjectChangeElement.NamespaceAgnosticEqualityComparer) is (Kind,Id) when Id is set, else
// (Kind,Name). So from CreateForRad's point of view a file rename that preserves the object's
// (Kind,Id-or-Name) IS a content edit (Modified) — only OUR OWN ObjectByPath bookkeeping needs
// to move the path. What is genuinely new is: (a) a "vacated" set — identities no longer found
// at their old path (a removed file, or a modified file whose declared identity itself changed,
// e.g. the AL object was renamed in place), and (b) an "appeared" set — new identities found
// this cycle (an added file, or a modified file whose identity changed). Any identity present in
// BOTH sets is a rename/move (Modified, tree taken from wherever it now lives); what is left in
// "appeared" is genuinely Added; what is left in "vacated" is genuinely Removed.
//
// The six id-less object kinds
// -------------------------------
// `Compilation.GetDeclaredApplicationObjectSymbols()` is typed to
// `ImmutableArray<IApplicationObjectTypeSymbol>`, and `IApplicationObjectTypeSymbol : ISymbolWithId`
// (decompiled and confirmed) — an id-less kind that does not satisfy this can never be found by
// asking "does this file declare an interface/controladdin/…" through it. Confirmed EMPIRICALLY
// (not just from the interface type hierarchy) that this API's actual behaviour splits the six
// unevenly: interface and controladdin genuinely never come back from it; profile,
// pagecustomization and profileextension DO (their symbol types implement ISymbolWithId after
// all) — but the Id that comes back is BC's own internal SymbolMap bookkeeping value (same
// pattern as InterfaceTypeSymbol.Id below), NOT stable across independently-constructed
// Compilations of the identically-named object, so it is NEVER trusted here: every one of the
// six is forced to a Name-keyed RadObjectIdentity (Id = null) regardless of which API found it or
// what numeric value that API happened to report (see the IdlessSymbolKinds.Contains guards in
// both ClassifyDeclaredObject and RecordIncrementalBaseline). Two different fallbacks for
// actually FINDING them:
//   - interface, controladdin, profile, pagecustomization, profileextension: BC's
//     SymbolReference.ModuleDefinition DOES represent all five (Interfaces/ControlAddIns/
//     Profiles/PageCustomizations/ProfileExtensions arrays — SerializableSymbolModelConverter
//     walks ALL declared objects, not just IApplicationObjectTypeSymbol ones), so this is the
//     fallback ClassifyDeclaredObject uses for interface/controladdin specifically (profile/
//     pagecustomization/profileextension are already caught by the id-bearing branch above,
//     Name-forced). Tracked across cycles via each element's own ReferenceSourceFileName — NOT
//     always the same string as tree.FilePath (confirmed empirically): with a RelativeFileSystem
//     attached (appRootDir != null, the normal --watch case — ControlAddIn/etc. resource paths
//     need one, see ControlAddInFileSystemTests) it comes back APP-ROOT-RELATIVE and must be
//     resolved against appRootDir; with none attached it is already absolute. LanguageElement.Id
//     is `int?` on EVERY *Definition type, including id-bearing ones (they just always populate
//     it) — so ExcludeObjects/MergeModuleDefinition below key by a generic "id:<n>" or "name:<x>"
//     string derived from the KIND (never trusting the reflected value for these five — see
//     ElementKey), and all five are merged into the baseline ModuleDefinition exactly like an
//     id-bearing kind, keyed by name.
//   - entitlement: the ONE kind with NO SymbolReference.ModuleDefinition representation AT ALL
//     (ModuleDefinition has no Entitlements array — confirmed by decompiling its property list).
//     It can never round-trip through packagedModuleDefinition, touched or not, so the ONLY way
//     it is ever present in ANY cycle's RAD compilation is by being included in `syntaxTrees`
//     THAT cycle. Every tracked entitlement file is therefore re-included in `syntaxTrees` on
//     EVERY incremental cycle regardless of whether it changed — proportional to the (typically
//     0-2) entitlement files in an app, not to the whole module — classified syntactically
//     (there is no semantic/ModuleDefinition path to find it) via the same "exactly one
//     ObjectSyntax child" technique Program.cs's IsFullAlObjectDeclaration already uses. It
//     produces no runtime C# (EntitlementSymbol has no Emit path), so this never inflates the
//     cached-C#-union.
//
// A `dotnet` package declaration is deliberately NOT in the recognised-kind set below (the
// issue's own list of forced-fallback conditions names it) — a file that declares one falls
// through ClassifyDeclaredObject's every branch and returns null, landing on the ordinary
// "declares 0 classifiable object(s)" fallback with no special-casing needed.
