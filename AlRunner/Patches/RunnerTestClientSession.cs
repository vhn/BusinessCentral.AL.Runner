// RunnerTestClientSession — the ITestClientSession BC's test harness expects a client to
// provide.
//
// WHERE IT IS USED
//   NavTestExecution.TestHandleModalForm pushes a delegate that builds the NavTestPage the
//   AL [ModalPageHandler] receives:
//       new NavTestPage(..., TestClientProxy<ITestPage>.Proxy(
//           testClientSession.GetPage(runRequest.Data.FormHandle)))
//   Real BC gets that session by Assembly.Load-ing the TestPageClient, which does not exist
//   in the runner — so testClientSession stayed null and the delegate NRE'd the moment the
//   dispatch reached it.
//
// WHAT GetPage RETURNS
//   The page BC already opened. The form is live and registered under the handle, so the
//   page under test is that form's own record and control tree — not a second instance
//   built alongside it. Handing back a fresh page would let the handler drive one object
//   while the AL that called RunModal observes another.
