// RunnerPageInstance — a live AL page object behind a TestPage.
//
// WHY
//   The runner's TestPage was a record cursor: it mapped only controls bound to a Rec
//   field, and on a miss passed the control's own id to the record as a field number,
//   producing "The supplied field number '1167935535' cannot be found in the 'X' table"
//   — a control-name FNV hash landing where a field number was expected.
//
//   A control does not have to bind to a table field. Binding one to a page global
//   variable is ordinary AL and the standard shape for a mode/filter selector above a
//   repeater. Resolving those needs the page's own control -> value binding table, which
//   only exists on an initialised NavForm: BC publishes it as NavForm.SourceExpressions,
//   keyed "Control{controlId}".
//
// WHAT THIS DOES
//   Constructs the compiled Page{id} (a real NavForm subclass carrying the page's AL
//   triggers as methods), opts it into BC's real initialisation (RunnerFormInit), and calls
//   SetSourceTable — which is BC's own front door: it funnels through EnsureMetadataLoaded
//   -> InitializeFromMetadata, binding the record, resolving controls against the source
//   table and running the page's own OnMetadataLoaded, the step that registers the source
//   expressions.
//
//   Driving those sub-steps individually is NOT an option, and the failure is instructive:
//   SetSourceTable already triggers them, so calling them again registers every expression
//   twice ("An item with the same key has already been added. Key: Control1167935535").
//   The service-tier state InitializeFromMetadata needs on the way (permissions, designer
//   customizations, tenant personalization) is handled where it belongs — in
//   NclCecilRewrite, once, for every caller — not by tiptoeing around the method here.
//
// SCOPE
//   Only pages the runner compiled itself have the metadata to build a control tree from
//   (see AlPageMetadataRegistry). For anything else TryCreate returns null and the caller
//   keeps its record-only behaviour, which is exactly what it had before.
