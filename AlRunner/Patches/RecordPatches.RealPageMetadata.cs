// RecordPatches.RealPageMetadata — opt a single page's NCLMetaForm into a REAL metadata
// load, on demand.
//
// WHY ON DEMAND
//   BuildNCLMetaForm runs at Register() time — before the compile that captures page
//   metadata XML — and force-sets metadataLoaded = true so BC's Populate() path stays
//   skipped. That flag is what makes every page a control-less skeleton: it tells BC
//   "already loaded", so LoadMetadata() never runs.
//
//   Flipping it for every page at build time is not possible (the metadata does not exist
//   yet) and flipping it for every page later is not desirable: pages living in a
//   precompiled dependency have no captured XML, and forcing a load for them would turn a
//   currently-harmless skeleton into a hard RunnerOutOfScopeException from the loader.
//   So the load is requested by the one caller that actually needs a control tree — the
//   TestPage path — and only for pages the runner compiled itself.
//
// WHAT A REAL LOAD BUYS
//   NCLMetaForm.LoadMetadata() -> LoadPageMetadata() -> CreatePageDefinitionWithExtensions()
//   -> ObjectLoader.MetaObjectCache.GetMetaPage(id, appGroup) parses the emit-captured XML
//   into a MetaPageDefinition: the page's real control tree, with each control's id and
//   what it is bound to. That tree is what NavForm registers its source expressions from,
//   and therefore the only thing that can resolve a control bound to a page VARIABLE
//   rather than to a Rec field.
//
// FAILURE POLICY
//   A page we have XML for that nonetheless fails to load is a runner gap, not something
//   to paper over: the caller is told (null) and reports it loudly rather than silently
//   continuing with a skeleton, which would answer TestPage questions wrongly instead of
//   refusing to answer them.
