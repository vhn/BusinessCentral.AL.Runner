///              coverage|omitted} —
///              single response, not streamed (matches v1: only runTests streams).
///              `capturedValues` (#1640) is present per test only when the request
///              set `captureValues:true`; each entry is {scopeName, variableName,
///              value, statementId, captureError|omitted} — see AlValueCapture.
///              `capturedValues` carries ONE ENTRY PER STATEMENT EXECUTION THAT
///              CHANGED A LOCAL'S VALUE, in execution order (#2074) — NOT one
///              end-of-test snapshot per variable. A local reassigned N times (e.g.
///              inside a loop) produces N entries sharing that assignment
///              statement's `statementId`, each with the value that execution
///              actually produced — a caller that only wants "the final value"
///              reads the LAST entry for a given `variableName`. A local that is
///              declared but never assigned produces NO entry at all (nothing
///              executed into existing it). `statementId` is the id-space
///              `coverage[].statements[].id` cross-references (see below) —
///              genuinely the statement that PRODUCED this value, never the
///              following one.
///              `captureError` (#2043) is present, non-null, only when the field
///              read or its ToString() threw; `value` is null in that case too but
///              MUST NOT be read as "genuinely null" — a genuinely null AL variable
///              has `captureError` absent.
///   `messages` (#2117) is the OnRun-driven codeunit's Message() calls, in the order
///   they were made — UNLIKE `capturedValues`/`coverage` there is no request field
///   that opts into this: an `execute` call always collects Message() output, so
///   "omitted" always means "zero messages produced", never "did not collect" (see
///   AlMessageCapture.Snapshot's doc comment — there is no not-collected state to
///   distinguish it from). Each entry is {text, scopeName, statementId}; `statementId`
///   is the SAME id-space `coverage[].statements[].id` / `capturedValues[].statementId`
///   use for the SAME scope, so a caller (SShadowS/ALchemist#1) can place a message at
///   the exact AL statement that produced it instead of guessing from a line count —
///   this matters for a loop, where the same source line calls Message() N times with
///   N different statement executions but only ONE statement id. A `[Test]` procedure's
///   Message() calls are UNCHANGED by this: they still raise BC's own "Unhandled UI"
///   when no [MessageHandler] is declared, exactly as before — see
///   AlRunner.Patches.RunnerClientCallback's header for why the two paths never
///   collide, and ServerExecuteMessagesTests for the regression guard.
///   `coverage` (#2042, on BOTH `runTests`' summary and `execute`'s response) is
///   present only when the request set `coverage:true`: one entry per AL source file,
///   {file, statements:[{id, scope, line, column, endLine, endColumn, hits}]}. `id` is
///   the SAME id-space as `capturedValues[].statementId` for the same `scope` — see
///   AlStatementTableTests. Supersedes the schema-only v1 `FileCoverage{file, lines[],
///   totalStatements, hitStatements}` shape (protocol-v2.schema.json never had a
///   working implementation of it, so there is no compatibility break): per-statement
///   detail with positions strictly subsumes a line-hit rollup, which a caller can
