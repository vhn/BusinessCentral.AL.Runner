// WatchSource — arms the `--watch` FileSystemWatchers.
//
// Moved out of Program.cs's top-level-statement local functions into its own internal
// static class for #1822: local functions declared inside top-level statements are
// nested inside the synthesized <Main>$ method and cannot be referenced from another
// file/class at all, so the arm-before-announce ordering contract had no way to be
// unit-tested. AlRunner.csproj already grants AlRunner.Tests InternalsVisibleTo, so an
// `internal` class here is directly testable — no new plumbing required.
//
// The bug this class exists to make impossible again: `--watch` used to print
// "[watch] waiting for AL source changes…" (or paint the interactive "● watching"
// dashboard) BEFORE arming the watchers. An edit landing in that window was lost —
// inotify has no backlog — so the process idled until killed. The fix is structural:
// `onArmed` is a caller-supplied callback that this class invokes itself, and ONLY
// after every FileSystemWatcher has EnableRaisingEvents = true. The caller can no
// longer announce "watching" before the watch is actually live, because the class
// controls when the announcement runs, not the caller.
