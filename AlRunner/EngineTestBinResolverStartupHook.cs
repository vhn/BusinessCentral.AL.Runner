// EngineTestBinResolverStartupHook — first half of the DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS chain that
// makes AlRunner.Tests' in-process BC engine tests (BcEngineCollection) actually execute.
// See AlRunner.Tests/EngineStartupHook.cs for the full mechanism and issue #1813.
//
// Why this lives in AlRunner.dll, as a SEPARATE hook from AlRunner.Tests.dll's own
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Measured: pointing DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS at AlRunner.Tests.dll alone is not sufficient.
// Entering ANY method the .NET hosting layer invokes on a startup-hook assembly forces
// that assembly's OWN [ModuleInitializer]s to run FIRST — including
// BcEngineBootstrap.Initialize() — but that happens BEFORE the body of AlRunner.Tests'
// own StartupHook.Initialize() gets a chance to run, so anything it does (installing a
// resolver, say) is already too late for BcEngineBootstrap.Initialize() itself. And
// BcEngineBootstrap.Initialize() needs one: a startup hook is loaded directly off its
// absolute path, outside VSTest's normal probing setup (AlRunner.Tests.deps.json isn't
// consulted yet — that wiring belongs to VSTest, and it hasn't run yet at this point in
// the host's startup sequence). Confirmed by reproduction: without this hook,
// BcEngineBootstrap.Initialize() throws FileNotFoundException for the `al-runner`
// assembly the moment it references AlRunner.Infrastructure.BcArtifacts.
//
// DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS runs every configured hook assembly's Initialize() IN THE ORDER
// LISTED (':'-separated on Linux). bc-tests.yml lists THIS assembly's bin-deployed
// copy inside AlRunner.Tests' own output directory FIRST, then AlRunner.Tests.dll SECOND
// — so this hook's Resolving handler is already installed by the time AlRunner.Tests.dll
// is entered and its module initializer runs.
//
// Why this hook ALSO clears DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS from the process environment
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Measured regression: environment variables set on the testhost process (this is set via
// VSTest's RunConfiguration.EnvironmentVariables, scoped to the testhost child process —
// see bc-tests.yml / engine.runsettings) are, by default, INHERITED by every subprocess
// the test suite itself spawns with Process.Start — and roughly two dozen AlRunner.Tests
// classes (CliServer, WatchTests, OutputFormatTests, …) spawn `dotnet run --project
// AlRunner …` to test the CLI/server's own behaviour. Left set, those child `al-runner`
// processes ALSO honour DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS (every corehost-launched .NET process does),
// re-running this whole bootstrap a second time inside the very PRODUCT the test is trying
// to observe — printing extra "[Cecil] …" / "[BcRuntime] …" diagnostic lines to its stdout
// before the line the test expects to be first (e.g. CliServer's `--server` readiness
// signal), and risking an outright assembly-identity conflict (two different-path copies of
// `al-runner`, itself and this hook's own copy, loaded into one AssemblyLoadContext).
//
// Clearing it here — the first hook in the chain, before AlRunner.Tests.dll (hook two) is
// even entered — does not undo the hooks already loaded into THIS process (hostfxr decided
// which hooks to run before any hook's managed code got a chance to execute), it only stops
// the variable from being read again if and when this process's own env is later inherited
// by a Process.Start call. That is exactly what we want: BcEngineBootstrap runs once, here,
// then gets out of the way of every subprocess-spawning test.
//
// Deliberately global namespace: DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS requires a non-nested,
// non-namespaced type literally named `StartupHook`.
