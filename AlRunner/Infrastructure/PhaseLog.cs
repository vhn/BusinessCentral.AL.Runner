// PhaseLog — opt-in, append-only, per-bundle + per-process cost instrumentation.
//
// Why (issue #1825)
// -----------------
// "Where does the CI matrix's wall clock actually go" is a question this repo has
// now asked three times, and each time it was answered by extrapolating from one
// hand-read log sample. The two facts that need measuring are:
//
//   * a per-PROCESS fixed tax — engine boot (`BC runtime patches applied`, ~4.5 s),
//     host startup and full-opt JIT (AlRunner.csproj sets
//     <TieredCompilation>false</TieredCompilation> so JmpHooks written at tier-0
//     addresses survive, which every process pays for at startup), and
//   * a per-BUNDLE tax, which is the one that dominates the single-process steps:
//     `Run runner-extras` originally compiled 38 bundles and took 2.5x as long as
//     `Run al-language corpus`, which has 5x the AL source in ONE bundle. Boot is
//     paid once in each, so it cannot be the explanation. (#1847 folded 16 of
//     those 38 bundles together, cutting the count to 23 — the per-bundle tax
//     this instrument measures is exactly what motivated that consolidation.)
//
// One record per process cannot see the second of those, so the primary unit here
// is the BUNDLE record, with a single process record carrying the once-per-process
// figures. `bundle_index` / `bundles_in_process` make the ordering recoverable, so
// "the 38th bundle costs more than the 2nd" (a quadratic term) is distinguishable
// from a flat per-bundle tax — a completely different bug with a different fix.
//
// Why a file and not stdout
// -------------------------
// AlRunner.Tests captures each spawned runner's stdout into a string and discards
// it unless the test fails, and several of those tests assert on the runner's exact
// stdout. Extra stdout lines would be both invisible and breaking. A file sidesteps
// both.
//
// Concurrency contract
// --------------------
// Since #1818 the unit-test suite runs 4-way parallel, so up to four runner
// processes append to the same log at once. Every record is written whole, under an
// exclusive open, never as a read-modify-write and never through a shared buffered
// writer. `FileMode.Append` alone is NOT sufficient — see the measurement in
// Append below, where the obvious FileShare.ReadWrite version silently loses 30% of
// its records. This is the last non-atomic write of its kind in the tree after
// #1818 made the dependency-source cache and the symbol cache atomic; do not
// "simplify" it back.
//
// Cost when unset
// ---------------
// AL_RUNNER_PHASE_LOG is read once into a static. Unset, `Install` registers no
// exit hook and every Note*/Begin*/End* entry point returns on a null check before
// allocating or reading a clock. Production pays a predictable-branch per call site.
