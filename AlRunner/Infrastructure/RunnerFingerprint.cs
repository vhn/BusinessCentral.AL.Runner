// RunnerFingerprint — the runner-identity component shared by every on-disk cache key
// (AL-output cache, source-workspace cache, source-dependency cache).
//
// Issue #1815, findings 2+3:
//
//   Finding 2 — every cache key used to write
//       runner:{File.GetLastWriteTimeUtc(runnerLoc).Ticks}:{length}
//   Every CI leg rebuilds the runner before running tests, so mtime moves on every run
//   even when the assembly's bytes are byte-for-byte identical. A cache persisted across
//   CI runs (actions/cache) would therefore MISS 100% of the time — the mtime line alone
//   defeated the entire point of persisting the cache.
//
//   Finding 3 — the trap in fixing finding 2 by itself. Replace the mtime with a content
//   hash and the runner's *content* is identical across all 8 BC-version legs (same
//   commit, same build) — so without something else in the key, all 8 legs would collide
//   on ONE cache entry, and whichever leg wrote first would poison every other leg with AL
//   output compiled against a different BC version's symbols. Today that collision is
//   avoided only *by accident*, because the mtime differs per leg's independent rebuild.
//
// Fix: hash the runner assembly's CONTENT (stable across rebuilds of unchanged source,
// unlike mtime) and pair it with an EXPLICIT bc:<version> line (so content-identical
// runners across legs still produce distinct keys per BC version). Both must land
// together — shipping finding 2 without finding 3 is a cache-poisoning regression, not
// a fix.
//
// SHA-256 of the full assembly bytes was chosen over the module's MVID. A clean Release
// rebuild of an unchanged source tree was verified (see issue #1815) to produce
// byte-identical output (.NET SDK's Deterministic=true default is on for this project),
// so the MVID would be equally stable here as a fingerprint — but hashing the ~1.6 MB
// al-runner.dll costs low single-digit milliseconds (measured: ~4 ms), immaterial next to
// the seconds an AL emit+compile takes, and a plain SHA-256 over the file avoids depending
// on PE/metadata-reader plumbing to extract an MVID from whatever on-disk shape a future
// publish (single-file, trimmed, ReadyToRun) leaves the assembly in. Simpler wins when the
// cost difference doesn't matter.
