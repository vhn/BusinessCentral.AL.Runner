// AlCoverageTracker — the runtime side of --coverage (issue #1922, first slice of the
// #1640 umbrella). Records a hit per (scope type, AL statement index) via a Cecil-rewrite
// hook on Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Ncl.dll's NavMethodScope.StmtHit(int) — see
// NclCecilRewrite.RewriteStmtHit — and turns the result into a Cobertura XML report.
//
// StmtHit already maintains NavMethodScope.StatementNumber (decompiled and confirmed;
// see the #1922 investigation notes), which AlCallStackCapture depends on for AL
// stack-trace "line L". The Cecil rewrite PREPENDS the hook call before StmtHit's
// existing body — it does not replace or touch that assignment — so stack traces are
// unaffected whether or not --coverage is passed.
//
// Counters are only recorded when Enabled is set (by --coverage); the hook call itself
// is unconditional in the rewritten IL (so the cached, rewritten Ncl.dll is identical
// whether or not a given run passes --coverage), but OnStmtHit no-ops immediately when
// Enabled is false. Observable behaviour on the default path — test results, timing,
// output — is therefore unchanged.
