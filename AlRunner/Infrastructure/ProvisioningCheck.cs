    // gap for an app that is already PRESENT (as symbol-only) in the cache. An empty
    // cache — no .alpackages at all, or a --package-cache dir that doesn't exist yet —
    // therefore reads as vacuously "Ok": nothing was found, so nothing looks broken, so
    // --auto-provision never fires and the run limps to a cryptic "Missing:" error deep
    // in dependency resolution instead. The bundle's OWN app.json manifests are an
    // independent source of truth for what's actually required, regardless of what
    // currently exists on disk — these functions consult THAT instead.
    //
    // Two curated, ATOMIC download sets exist (see ArtifactDownloader.PlatformApps /
    // .TestApps): a project either needs the whole platform-apps set or none of it (same
    // for test-apps) — there is no per-app partial download. So a DOWNLOAD, once triggered,
    // always fetches the full set. But "is it already satisfied" must NOT require every
    // member of that set to be individually present on disk: System/Base Application and
    // Business Foundation have a service-tier DLL dispatch fallback (the runner runs their
    // codeunits even with no .app vendored at all — see KnownPlatformRuntimeApps' doc
    // comment; only PRESENT-but-symbol-only is a gap for them, unchanged, via
    // CheckPlatformApps). Application Test Library has NO such fallback (see
    // ArtifactDownloader.PlatformApps' comment on it) — a bundle that needs it is
    // unresolvable without a real .app in cache. So the "must be literally present" check
    // is scoped to KnownNoFallbackPlatformApps, not the whole downloadable set — requiring
    // the whole set would regress nearly every bundle in the corpus (virtually all of them
