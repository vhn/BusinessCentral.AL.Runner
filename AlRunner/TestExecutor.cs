    // "install-seed" sequence, keyed by InstallTriggerRunner.CurrentDependencySetKey()
    // (the exact ordered set of loaded dependency assemblies, by Module Version ID).
    // #1866 measured this pair at 62.4% + 20.1% = 82.5% of run_ms across 23 runner-extras
    // app groups that all shared the identical 12-assembly dependency closure (issue's own
    // "APP STAGES" table) — every one of the 23 re-executed the SAME MS System-Application
    // Install codeunits (Email Installer, Plan Installer, ...) and re-ran codeunit 2 from
    // scratch.
    //
    // WHY CACHING THE SNAPSHOT IS LOSSLESS — the structural argument, not an appeal to
    // BC's Install-trigger contract:
    //
    // A HIT restores table rows only (RestoreInstallBaselineSnapshot →
    // RecordPatches.InstallBaseline.cs), so at first glance any NON-table side effect a
    // dependency Install trigger left in process-wide state — SingleInstance codeunit
    // instance variables, the shared-object container, write-transaction state, MediaSet /
    // RecordLink / IsolatedStorage entries stashed outside a table row — would not be
    // reproduced on a HIT. That would be a real gap.
    //
    // It isn't one, because every codeunit boundary in this run — INCLUDING the app
    // group's very first codeunit — calls RecordPatches.RestoreInstallBaseline() (see the
    // TestIsolation.Codeunit / TestIsolation.Test branches further down in this file), and
    // that call begins with ResetPerTestState() (RecordPatches.cs), which unconditionally
    // wipes exactly those things: _dataAccessByTable per-table rows,
    // RecordLinkPatches.ResetForTest(), TenantStoragePatches.ResetForTest(),
    // MediaSetPatches.ResetForTest(), ALDatabasePatches.ResetWriteTransactionState(),
    // BcRuntime.DisposeSkeletonSharedObjectContainerChildren(), and
    // BcRuntime.ResetSingleInstanceCache(). So the set of install-seed state that can ever
    // survive to the moment ANY test body runs is exactly
    // {table rows, isolated storage, record links, auto-increment} — precisely the four
    // things InstallBaselineSnapshot captures. A non-table side effect of a dependency
    // Install trigger was already unobservable to every test BEFORE this cache existed;
    // caching the snapshot doesn't create a new gap, it caches the only part of the
    // dependency Install/Company-Initialize output that was ever able to reach a test in
    // the first place.
    //
    // Two supporting facts, both verified rather than assumed: rows are CloneValues-copied
    // (with NavBLOB.DeepCopy for BLOB fields) on BOTH capture (buffer.ToArray()) and
    // restore (new ReadOnlyRecordBuffer(..., CloneValues(values))), so no live row can alias
    // into the process-lifetime snapshot — this matters more here than for the
    // CaptureInstallBaseline singleton this is modelled on, because one aliased row here
    // would corrupt every subsequent app group sharing this dep key, not just one. And the
    // virtual/system metadata tables (Field, AllObj, AllObjWithCaption, table id ≥
    // 2,000,000,000) that grow monotonically as more test assemblies load in-process are not
    // a staleness hazard for a HIT either: GetDataAccessForTableCore re-populates them on
    // EVERY access as an idempotent top-up, so restoring an earlier app group's narrower
    // subset self-corrects on the next read.
    //
    // NOT cached here: the bundle's OWN test assembly's Install triggers
    // (InstallTriggerRunner.RunTestAssemblyOnly, genuinely per-app-group, always re-run) and
    // CaptureInstallBaseline's per-app-group singleton (which layers the bundle's own
    // install-seeded rows on top of whichever dep+company snapshot below was used, and is
    // what RestoreInstallBaseline's per-codeunit/per-test boundary restores — unaffected by
    // this cache either way).
    //
    // Kill switch: set AL_RUNNER_NO_DEP_COMPANY_CACHE=1 to force every lookup to MISS (see
    // the cache-or-compute call site below). Exists for diagnostic blast radius — this cache
    // is process-lifetime and shared across every app group in the process, so it is

    // (see that file) parks this exact thread — synchronously, inside the test's own
    // call stack — for as long as a --dap client takes to decide its next command,
    // which for a real interactive debugger (or a client merely slow under load) is
    // routinely more than DefaultTestTimeoutSeconds. When the watchdog's thread.Join
    // times out mid-pause it reports the test as "Error: Test exceeded Ns timeout" and
    // TestExecutor moves on — but the parked background thread is NOT released (nothing
    // calls AlDapSession.Continue()/Detach() on its behalf), so it stays blocked in
    // gate.Wait() forever, and the DAP client's pending ReadUntilEventAsync("stopped")
    // now waits for an event that source thread can never again produce: the exact
    // "client reads forever, nothing was actually still armed to answer it" hang
    // reproduced (twice, under CPU contention) for #2070 — see DapServerTests'
    // Dap_LongPauseAcrossWatchdogTimeout_DoesNotAbortTheTest for the deterministic
    // repro (shrinks AL_RUNNER_TEST_TIMEOUT_SEC on the child process so the race is
    // a few seconds, not a real 60s+ wait).

    // The watchdog exists to catch a runaway/infinite-looping AL TEST BODY running
    // unattended; it was never meant to bound how long a human (or a client standing in
    // for one) takes to single-step. A --dap session is a single-shot, one-client
    // process a developer is actively driving, and it already has its own, deliberate
    // way to interrupt a hung AL loop: VS Code's "stop debugging" sends `disconnect`,
    // which AlDapSession.Detach() answers immediately (releases the gate, subsequent
    // StmtHits run straight through) — so the watchdog is not filling a gap here, it is
    // firing where a real gap doesn't exist and manufacturing this one instead. Bypass
