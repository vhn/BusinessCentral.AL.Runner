// JoinContext — the delegate boundary between al-runner.dll and the isolated
// join executor. al-runner builds this (its delegates close over al-runner's own
// reflection helpers / static caches) and hands it to JoinExecutor.Execute.
//
// CRUCIAL: every member here is typed in terms of `object`, `Array`, `Func`/`Action`,
// and BCL primitives ONLY — no Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.* type appears in any signature.
// That keeps this assembly (and the thin shim in al-runner that references it) free of
// Ncl-referencing IL, so neither perturbs al-runner.dll's startup ReadyToRun binding.
