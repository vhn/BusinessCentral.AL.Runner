# Server mode (`--server`)

`al-runner --server` is a long-running JSON-RPC daemon over stdin/stdout. It loads
the BC runtime patches and the dependency symbol set **once**, then serves many
test runs in the same warm process — turning a ~19 s cold run into ~4 s per
request. The VS Code extension depends on this flag. `runTests` streams the
protocol-v2 NDJSON shape (`protocol-v2.schema.json`, see #1641); `cancel` is a
side channel that can interrupt a `runTests` in progress (see below); every
other command (`execute`, `shutdown`, errors) is a single response line.

```
al-runner --server [--package-cache PATH ...] [--cache DIR]
```

## Transport

- **Newline-delimited JSON.** One JSON object per line. stdin = requests,
  stdout = responses.
- **stdout carries ONLY the protocol.** All banners, `[cache]` lines and BC patch
  logs are redirected to **stderr**. The very first line on stdout is the
  readiness signal:

  ```json
  {"ready":true}
  ```

  Wait for it before sending the first request. (On a cold start the runner may
  re-exec itself once for a clean Cecil load; the child inherits the same stdio,
  so the readiness line still arrives on the same pipe — just later.)

## Requests

```jsonc
{
  "command": "runTests",        // runTests | execute | cancel | shutdown (case-insensitive)
  "sourcePaths": ["/path/app"], // bundle dir(s); ALL are run and aggregated —
                                 // e.g. an app + its separate test app, same
                                 // shape as `al-runner MyApp MyApp.Test` on
                                 // the CLI (inter-bundle deps get wired first)
  "packagePaths": ["/extra"],   // optional: extra .app caches, augment server defaults
  "stubPaths": [],              // v1 field, ignored in v2 (no stubs layer)
  "code": "...",                // execute only (inline AL); mutually exclusive with sourcePaths
  "captureValues": false,       // execute only — see #1640
  "coverage": false,            // runTests + execute — per-statement hit counts + position table, see #2042
  "testIsolation": "codeunit"   // optional: "codeunit" (default) | "test"/"method" | "disabled"
                                 // — see #1616. Applies to this request only; a later
                                 // request that omits the field falls back to the
                                 // server's own startup default, not the previous
                                 // request's value.
}
```

## Responses

### `runTests` — streaming (protocol-v2)

Unlike every other command, `runTests` is **not** a single response line. It
emits zero or more `test` lines — one per completed test, in the order each
test finishes, flushed immediately so a client sees results as they happen
instead of waiting for the whole bundle — followed by exactly one terminal
`summary` line. A request naming multiple `sourcePaths` runs them in order and
streams `test` lines across all of them before the one final `summary`.

```jsonc
{"type":"test","name":"Codeunit60110.MyTest","status":"pass","durationMs":12}
{"type":"test","name":"Codeunit60110.OtherTest","status":"fail","durationMs":3,
 "message":"NavNCLDialogException: boom","errorKind":"runtime",
 "stackFrames":[{"name":"\"My Test CU\"(CodeUnit 60110).OtherTest","line":2,
                 "presentationHint":"normal"}],
 "stackTrace":"..."}
{"type":"summary","exitCode":1,"passed":1,"failed":1,"errors":0,"total":2,
 "cached":false,"changedFiles":["XRecProbe.Table.al"],"compilationErrors":null,
 "protocolVersion":2}
```

- `status` is `pass` | `fail` | `error` | `skipped`.
- `stackTrace` is the AL call stack for AL-originated errors, falling back to
  the raw C# exception for runner-internal failures (matching the normal-mode
  rule). `message`/`stackTrace` are omitted (not `null`) on a passing test.
- `errorKind` buckets the failure so a client can vary its UI:
  `runtime` · `setup` (thrown before any `[Test]` body ran — codeunit
  instantiation) · `timeout` (the per-test `--test-timeout` guard fired) ·
  `compile` · `assertion` · `unknown` (an error with no exception behind it).
  Omitted entirely on a `pass`/`skipped` — there is no error to bucket.
  Note: BC's `Assert` codeunits ultimately call AL `Error()`, which surfaces as
  the same `NavNCLDialogException` as any other AL error, so assertion failures
  currently report `runtime`; see the note in `AlRunner/ErrorClassifier.cs`.
- `stackFrames` is `stackTrace` parsed into structured frames — same order
  (deepest first), one object per frame, with `name`, and `line` when BC
  supplied one. Omitted when no AL call stack was captured (a runner-internal
  failure); never emitted as an empty array, and `source`/`column` are omitted
  rather than invented, since BC's call-stack format carries no file path.
- `exitCode`: `0` ok · `1` test fail · `2` exec · `3` compile (same ladder as
  normal mode).
- `changedFiles` is only present on a cache miss (a hit means nothing changed);
  `compilationErrors` is only present when non-empty.
- `cached: true` means the AL-output compile was skipped (assembly served from
  the on-disk cache) — the tests still ran for real and still streamed.
- A bundle that fails to compile short-circuits straight to the `summary` line
  with `exitCode: 3` and `compilationErrors` set — no `test` lines for that
  bundle (there was nothing to run).
- `cancelled: true` is present on the summary only when a concurrent `cancel`
  command actually stopped the run before every test ran (see `cancel` below);
  omitted otherwise (never emitted as `false`).
- `coverage` (#2042) is present on the summary only when the request set
  `coverage: true` — see "Per-statement hit counts (`coverage`)" below.

A request-level problem (e.g. a missing `sourcePaths`) returns the usual single
`{"error":"..."}` line instead of a `test`/`summary` sequence — see Errors below.

### `cancel` — side channel, works mid-stream

```json
{"command":"cancel"}
```

```json
{"type":"ack","command":"cancel","noop":false}
```

Cooperative cancellation for an in-flight `runTests` request. Unlike every
other command, `cancel` is answered **immediately**, even while `runTests` is
still streaming `test` lines — a dedicated stdin-reader thread recognises it
the instant it is read, independent of the normal one-request-at-a-time
dispatch loop. That is the whole point: cancellation is only useful if the
signal can reach the runner mid-run rather than being queued behind it.

- `noop: false` — a run was active and this cancel signalled it. The already-
  running test still finishes (a test body is never interrupted mid-flight);
  the *next* test does not start. The terminating `summary` line for that run
  carries `cancelled: true`.
- `noop: true` — nothing to cancel: no `runTests` request was active, the
  active one had already finished, or an earlier `cancel` already signalled it.
  Sending `cancel` with no run in flight is a well-defined no-op, not an error.
- `cancel` accepts and ignores any extra fields on the request object
  (forward-compatible with future protocol additions).
- There is at most one active run at a time; `cancel` has no request/run id to
  target — it always addresses whichever `runTests` request is currently
  streaming, matching v1's shape (#1613/#1614).

### `execute`

Runs each bundle's first `OnRun`-bearing codeunit (run-mode). Unlike `runTests`
this is **not** streamed — one v1-shaped response line, no `type` discriminator:

```json
{"exitCode":0,"tests":[{"name":"Codeunit60110.OnRun","status":"pass","durationMs":7}]}
```

v1's `execute` also accepted an inline `code` string and a `captureValues` flag.
v2 now supports `code` too (#1917): a temp single-file bundle is synthesised
from it and run through the same compile pipeline `sourcePaths` uses. `code`
that already parses as a full AL object declaration — any object keyword
(`table`, `codeunit`, `page`, `enum`, `report`, `query`, `xmlport`,
`interface`, ... the whole AL object-keyword set, including behind a leading
`//` comment) — is used verbatim; anything else is treated as a bare statement
list and wrapped in a scratch codeunit's `OnRun` trigger body — matching v1's
CLI `-e` shape. Classification asks BC's own parser
(`SyntaxTree.ParseObjectText`) rather than matching a keyword prefix, so it
covers every object type BC supports, not just `codeunit`/`table` (#1931):

```json
{"command":"execute","code":"Message('hi');"}
```

```json
{"exitCode":0,"tests":[{"name":"AL Runner Inline Execute.OnRun","status":"pass","durationMs":4}]}
```

`code` and `sourcePaths` are mutually exclusive — sending both is a
request-level error.

`captureValues: true` (#1640) reports ONE ENTRY PER STATEMENT EXECUTION that
changed a top-level AL local's value, in execution order — not a single
end-of-test snapshot (#2074) — captured via Cecil hooks on
`NavMethodScope.StmtHit(int)` (every intermediate execution) and
`NavMethodScope.Exit()` (the final one), not a pass over emitted AL output
(see `AlRunner/Infrastructure/AlValueCapture.cs`). `capturedValues` is present
per test only when the request set the flag; each entry is `{scopeName,
variableName, value, statementId, captureError|omitted}`:

```json
{"command":"execute","captureValues":true,
 "code":"codeunit 50100 X { trigger OnRun() var Msg: Text; begin Msg := 'hi'; end; }"}
```

```json
{"exitCode":0,"tests":[{"name":"X.OnRun","status":"pass","durationMs":5,
 "capturedValues":[{"scopeName":"OnRun","variableName":"Msg","value":"hi","statementId":0}]}]}
```

A local reassigned N times (e.g. inside a loop) produces N entries sharing
that assignment statement's `statementId`, each carrying the value that
execution actually produced — never collapsed to just the final one. A caller
that only wants "the final value" reads the LAST entry for a given
`variableName`. A local that is declared but never assigned produces NO entry
at all — nothing executed a value into it, so there is no execution to
report. The next example shows the SAME variable assigned twice on two
different statements — TWO entries, not one:

```json
{"command":"execute","captureValues":true,
 "code":"codeunit 50101 X2 { trigger OnRun() var Msg: Text; begin Msg := 'hi'; Msg := 'bye'; end; }"}
```

```json
{"exitCode":0,"tests":[{"name":"X2.OnRun","status":"pass","durationMs":1,
 "capturedValues":[
   {"scopeName":"OnRun","variableName":"Msg","value":"hi","statementId":0},
   {"scopeName":"OnRun","variableName":"Msg","value":"bye","statementId":1}]}]}
```

`captureError` (issue #2043) is present, non-null, only when the runtime could
not faithfully read or render this variable — either the reflective field
read itself threw, or the raw value's own `ToString()` threw. It names the
exception type (e.g. `"field read threw NotSupportedException"`). `value` is
`null` in that case, but this must not be confused with a genuinely null AL
variable: a genuinely null variable is reported with `value:null` and
`captureError` **absent**. A variable whose read failed is never simply
omitted from the array — that would be indistinguishable from "this variable
does not exist" (`.claude/rules/loud-failures.md`).

### Per-statement hit counts (`coverage`)

`coverage: true` (#2042) opts into a per-statement hit-count + position table on
**both** `runTests`' terminal `summary` line and `execute`'s response — reusing
`--coverage`'s existing `StmtHit`/`CStmtHit` hook (#1922), no new instrumentation.
`coverage` is an array with one entry per AL source file; each file's
`statements` array has one entry per BC-instrumented statement:

```json
{"command":"execute","captureValues":true,"coverage":true,
 "code":"codeunit 50100 X { trigger OnRun() var Msg: Text; begin Msg := 'hi'; Msg := 'bye'; end; }"}
```

```json
{"exitCode":0,"tests":[{"name":"X.OnRun","status":"pass","durationMs":7,
 "capturedValues":[
   {"scopeName":"OnRun","variableName":"Msg","value":"hi","statementId":0},
   {"scopeName":"OnRun","variableName":"Msg","value":"bye","statementId":1}]}],
 "coverage":[{"file":"/tmp/.../Scratch.al","statements":[
   {"id":0,"scope":"OnRun","line":1,"column":57,"endLine":1,"endColumn":69,"hits":1},
   {"id":1,"scope":"OnRun","line":1,"column":70,"endLine":1,"endColumn":83,"hits":1}]}]}
```

- **`id` is the SAME id-space as `capturedValues[].statementId` for the SAME
  `scope`.** This is the feature's actual point: `--capture-values` (#2040)
  emits a `statementId` with no reliable way to place it in an editor short of
  treating it as an index into a sorted covered-lines list — a heuristic that
  breaks on multi-statement lines and skipped statements (see the upstream
  request, SShadowS/ALchemist#1). `coverage[].statements[].id` resolves it
  exactly: look up the entry whose `scope` matches `capturedValues[].scopeName`
  and whose `id` matches `capturedValues[].statementId`, and its `line`/`column`
  is the real AL source position that value was captured at.
- **Per statement, never per line.** Two statements sharing a source line are
  two separate entries with their own `hits`, not one summed count — the
  distinction a plain line-coverage rollup necessarily discards. A line rollup
  is still trivial to derive client-side (group `statements` by `line`, sum
  `hits`); the reverse is not.
- `line`/`column`/`endLine`/`endColumn` are 1-based, decoded from BC's own
  `[SourceSpans]` attribute (`AlSourceSpanCodec`) — the same source
  `--coverage`'s Cobertura output and `--capture-values`' `statementId` both
  already read.
- `hits` is the number of times that exact statement executed in **this**
  request — not accumulated across the server process's lifetime. A statement
  hit 0 times (an untaken branch) is still listed, not omitted — "did not
  execute" is a real, distinct answer from "not part of this scope".
- Supersedes protocol-v2.schema.json's older, never-implemented
  `FileCoverage{file, lines[], totalStatements, hitStatements}` shape — that
  shape was schema-only (this repo never shipped a working `coverage` producer
  for it), so there is no compatibility break. Per-statement detail with
  positions strictly subsumes a line-hit rollup.
- `coverage` is omitted entirely (not an empty array) when the request didn't
  set `coverage: true`; a non-null but empty `coverage: []` means "asked,
  nothing was instrumented" (e.g. a compile failure before any AL code ran) —
  the same "requested vs found nothing" distinction `capturedValues` already
  makes.

### `shutdown`

```json
{"status":"shutting down"}
```

The server writes this response, then exits. EOF on stdin also exits.

### Errors

Any request-level problem returns `{"error":"<message>"}` and the server keeps
running.

## The reload contract (same-bundle, in-process)

The server's value is staying warm across **edits**. .NET cannot unload an
assembly, so a re-emitted bundle is a *new* assembly loaded alongside the old one
(both under the same module name `V2_<bundle>`). Before each `runTests`, the
server calls `BcRuntime.ResetForNewBundleReload()`, which:

- drops every bundle-derived cache: record/codeunit/page/report/query/xmlport CLR
  type caches, the NCLMetaTable/metaForm/etc. caches, parsed table/extension
  schemas, the registered source dirs, the AL enum registry, and the **in-memory
  table rows** (so an edited re-run starts clean instead of seeing the previous
  run's Inserts);
- preserves the installed hooks and resolved runtime reflection handles.

AL-output type finders (`FindRecordType`, the codeunit/event finders) then prefer
`BcRuntime.CurrentTestAssembly`, and stale previous-bundle assemblies are skipped
(`BcRuntime.IsStaleBundleAssembly`), so the freshly-emitted types win over the
same-named types still loaded from the previous run.

### Covered: code / logic edits

Edits to triggers and procedure/codeunit bodies are picked up fully — the new
compiled IL runs because the CLR type is resolved fresh against the new assembly.

### Forgetting a cached BC object does not end its life

The reset above is a *runner* concern; the per-test-isolation reset
(`RecordPatches.ResetPerTestState`, which runs at every codeunit — or, under
`--test-isolation method`, every test — boundary) is where BC-side state is dropped, and
it has a rule of its own worth stating because it cost a real bug.

Every `NavCodeunit` the runner caches is *also* rooted in the skeleton session's own tree.
Clearing the runner's dictionary drops the runner's pointer; BC's reference count never
moves and the instance lives on. For most state that is invisible — the next lookup builds
a fresh instance and the stale one is simply unreachable AL. One kind of state is not
invisible, because BC keeps it on the session rather than on the instance:
**manual event bindings**.

`Session.EventBindings` is BC's own record of every `BindSubscription`, and BC removes an
entry as the bound instance's tree is disposed — which is how AL's *"the binding ends when
the variable goes out of scope"* is implemented. `TestExecutor` disposes the test codeunit
at the end of its run, so a subscriber bound through a test-codeunit global is unbound
correctly. A subscriber owned by a `SingleInstance` codeunit is not: that instance is only
forgotten, never disposed, so the binding stayed live for the whole **process** — firing
into every later test codeunit and every later `--watch` cycle, none of which had bound
anything. Reading the SingleInstance codeunit's own fields could not reveal this; a reset
that hands out a fresh instance zeroes the fields while the old instance, and its binding,
carry on.

`ResetPerTestState` therefore also calls `BcRuntime.ClearManualEventBindings()`, which
empties that list — the same operation AL's `UnbindSubscription` performs, applied to
everything still bound at the boundary.

**Sweeping the list, not destroying the instances, is deliberate.** Disposing cached
`SingleInstance` codeunits at this boundary was tried and rejected: BC's own machinery
still holds references to some of them, and the reporting path then died with
`ObjectDisposedException: 'Tree'` out of `NavSystemCodeunit.Invoke` — 11 corpus tests,
measured. The binding list is the piece of that instance's state that actually reaches
the next test, and it is BC's own bookkeeping, so emptying it is both sufficient and safe.

Pinned by `AlRunner.Tests/WatchStateResidencyTests` (fixture
`Fixtures/WatchStateResidency`), which re-runs one test across three `--watch` cycles and
fails if a binding, a `SingleInstance` field or a committed row from any earlier execution
is still visible at the start of a later one.

### Known limitation: field / table **shape** edits

The runner does **not** clear BC's own skeleton `NCLMetadata.metadataCacheEntries`
on reload (it also holds dependency BC-table metadata, and clearing it wholesale
is risky). That cache keeps the **field set** of a table from the first time it was
seen. So adding/removing/retyping a *field* (or other table-shape change) is not
reliably picked up by a warm reload — restart the server after a schema change.
Trigger/logic edits within an unchanged field layout are fine.

## Exit codes

Same ladder as normal mode: `0` all pass · `1` test failures · `2` execution
error · `3` compilation error. In server mode the code rides on each `runTests`
response's `exitCode`; the process itself exits `0` on `shutdown`/EOF.
