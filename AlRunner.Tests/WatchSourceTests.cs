// WatchTests.Watch_PicksUpEdit_InProcess_OnNextCycle (spawns the real runner, polls the
// console for the "waiting for AL source changes" marker on a 200ms loop, then edits the
// fixture) is a flaky reproduction of the race, not a proof: whether it goes red depends
// on OS scheduling luck between Console.Out.Flush() and EnableRaisingEvents = true. These
// tests instead encode the ordering CONTRACT directly — onArmed is invoked by
// WatchSource itself, only once every FileSystemWatcher is already live — so an edit made
// from *inside* onArmed is the earliest possible moment a real editor could race the
// watcher, and it must always be seen. No polling, no console output, no child process.
