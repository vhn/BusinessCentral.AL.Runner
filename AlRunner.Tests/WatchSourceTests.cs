// WatchTests.Watch_PicksUpEdit_InProcess_OnNextCycle (spawns the real runner, polls the

// on OS scheduling luck between Console.Out.Flush() and EnableRaisingEvents = true. These
// tests instead encode the ordering CONTRACT directly — onArmed is invoked by
// WatchSource itself, only once every FileSystemWatcher is already live — so an edit made
// from *inside* onArmed is the earliest possible moment a real editor could race the
// watcher, and it must always be seen. No polling, no console output, no child process.
