/// #1641 (`cancel` command slice): --server's `cancel` side channel and the

///
/// Wire shapes follow v1 verbatim (PRs #1613/#1614, closed on the v1 architecture
/// but ported here per the issue's own instructions): the ack is
/// <c>{"type":"ack","command":"cancel","noop":bool}</c>, and the terminal
/// `summary` line carries <c>cancelled:true</c> only when the cancel actually
/// stopped the run early.
///
/// The no-active-run tests need no BC compile at all (cancel is answered
/// instantly regardless of whether anything has ever been compiled) and always
/// run. The tests that need a real run in flight need the BC artifact caches;
/// they report Skipped (not Passed) when absent — see TestArtifacts, same convention
/// as CacheKeyDependencyClosureTests.
///
/// See DefineFlagIntegrationTests for why this class used to be
/// [Collection("server-serial")] and no longer is — #1809. The one genuine
/// concurrency hazard this class ever exposed — a TOCTOU race in
/// HandleServerRunTests clearing activeRunCts too late relative to when a client
/// could observe the summary and fire `cancel` — is fixed at the source (see the
/// #1809 comment in Program.cs's HandleServerRunTests) rather than papered over
