// BcEngineCollection — serializes the tests that load the BC engine IN-PROCESS and
// performs the Ncl Cecil rewrite exactly once, before any of them runs.
//
// The race being fixed
// --------------------
// Production (Program.cs) Cecil-rewrites Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Ncl.dll in-place in the
// app's own bin dir BEFORE anything touches it, then re-execs on a cold rewrite so the
// child starts clean. A test host cannot re-exec, and — worse — xUnit runs test classes
// from different collections in PARALLEL in one process. So one class could call
// NclCecilRewrite.RewriteInPlace() (which OVERWRITES bin/…Ncl.dll on disk) while another
// class was concurrently loading types out of that very file.
//
// The reader then mapped a half-written image, which surfaced as torn-metadata errors far
// from the cause and with a different face each run:
//   - BadImageFormatException "Index not found. (0x80131124)"
//   - CultureNotFoundException from RuntimeAssembly.GetLocale() reading a garbage locale
//   - TypeInitializationException on NavEnvironment (un-rewritten cctor -> WindowsIdentity)
// Which class won the race decided which one failed, so the two tests appeared to fail
// alternately and neither reproduced in isolation.
//
// The fix: every test that touches the in-process BC engine joins this collection.
// DisableParallelization keeps them off each other, and the fixture below does the rewrite
// once at collection start — so the file is fully written before any member test loads it,
// and nothing rewrites it again afterwards.
//
// Members: BcCompilerEmitRetryTests, SkeletonSharedObjectContainerLeakTests,
// RecordBulkWriteNotesTransactionTests.
// Any NEW test that loads Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.* types in-process belongs here too.
