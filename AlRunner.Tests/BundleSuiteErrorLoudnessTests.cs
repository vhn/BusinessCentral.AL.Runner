// BundleSuiteErrorLoudnessTests — a suite that fails to emit must fail the run even when
// its SIBLING suites in the same bundle still produce passing tests.
//
// EmitExclusionLoudnessTests already covers the single-suite shape, and it passed — but it
// passed for a reason that does not generalise. On exclusion, Program.cs empties the broken
// module's sources ("do not run a module that is missing objects"), so in a ONE-suite bundle
// zero tests survive. The bundle-level guard was:
//
//     if (bundleTests.Count == 0 && bundleErrors.Count > 0) bundleStage = CompileFailed;
//
// i.e. it required the bundle to come out EMPTY. One healthy sibling suite is enough to keep
// bundleTests non-empty, and then every suite error becomes invisible to the exit code, which
// is computed from bucket Stage + per-test outcomes only.
//
// That is the canonical mode for this repo (bundled per-bucket runs), so the loudness
// guarantee was absent exactly where it matters most. Measured on the real matrix: BC 27.0 ran
// 26 of ~76 runner-extras tests with 16 suite errors and exited 0, and BC 28.0 ran 8 of 76 with
// 14 suite errors and exited non-zero ONLY because one surviving test happened to fail. Had it
// passed, a leg that compiled almost nothing would have reported green.
//
// See .claude/rules/loud-failures.md — a green run that quietly covers less is the "green test
// that lies" this rule exists to prevent.
