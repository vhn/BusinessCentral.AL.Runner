// LogUserFacingTagsTests — Log's [Component] filter must not eat user-facing output.
//
// Root cause being tested
// -----------------------
// Log.Install() suppresses any line starting with a `[Tag]` unless --verbose, to hide
// internal diagnostics. The BC-version selection lines are written unconditionally and
// were plainly meant to be seen:
//   [bc] no --bc-version given — selecting latest cached BC 28.x ...
//   [bc] selected BC <version> (<path>)
// but `[bc]` matched the generic tag pattern and was NOT exempted, so both vanished at
// default verbosity.
//
// Measured cost, 2026-07-29: the same Pageworks suite scores 1041P/35F/0E with
// `--bc-version 28.1` and 996P/77F/3E with the default selection — 42 tests and 3
// errors on a choice the runner made silently, then declined to mention. An agent
// investigating the difference had no way to see which version was in play and
// attributed the failure to a nonexistent missing-native-method gap.
//
// Selecting a BC version and naming the winning dependency package are results, not
// diagnostics. They stay visible.
