// BcCompilerEmitRetryTests — atomic-per-module Emit resilience.
//
// Root cause being guarded
// -------------------------
// BC's Compilation.Emit(...) is atomic PER MODULE: if even one object in a large
// dependency package throws while emitting (an internal BC-emitter crash — e.g. a
// DotNet variable whose type never resolved, "Unexpected value 'None' of type
// NavTypeKind", or a bound-tree shape BC's codegen doesn't expect), the WHOLE
// module's Sources come back empty — EVERY object is lost, including perfectly
// valid, unrelated codeunits sitting next to the broken one.
//
// This produced the reported Pageworks Copilot-flow failure: "System Application
// Test Library" (177 objects) had ~18-20 broken mock/test-page objects unrelated to
// Copilot. Compilation.Emit threw once for the whole package, so even the healthy
// "Copilot Test Library" codeunit (132932) never got a real .NET type. At runtime,
// codeunit dispatch fell back to a NoOp stub for the unresolved id, and the NoOp's
// inherited OnInvoke unconditionally throws NavNCLMissingMethodException for ANY
// procedure call. That exception's message hardcodes literal "0" as the object id
// (Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Types.Exceptions.NavNCLMissingMethodException.CreateMessage
// does `string.Format(culture, Lang.WrongReference, methodId, 0)` — unconditionally),
// which is why the failure read "the object with ID 0" even though ObjectId stamping
// (the unrelated "212-wall" ctor-replacement fix) was working correctly the whole
// time — confirmed by diagnostics before this fix was written; see PR description.
//
// Fix: BcCompiler.Emit now parses BC's own per-object failure info out of a crashed
// Emit() (either the AggregateException's "Object:'<Type> <Ns>."<Name>"'" text, or —
// for a crash that surfaces as a second-wave plain compile error instead of a thrown
// exception — the EmitResult.Diagnostics' real Location.SourceTree), excludes just
// those broken source files, and retries — iteratively, since excluding one crashing
// object can unmask another previously-hidden one — up to a bounded number of rounds.
//
// Test strategy
// -------------
// Model the general pattern with two minimal, synthetic AL objects compiled as one
// module: one object designed to crash BC's emitter (an unresolvable DotNet variable
// type — the same NavTypeKind.None crash class documented above), and one ordinary,
// healthy codeunit. Assert the healthy codeunit's method is still emitted (a concrete
// value assertion — RED before the retry-loop fix throws away BOTH objects; GREEN
// after it recovers the healthy one).
//
// Env-guarded like VersionAgnosticClosureTests: only runs when BC service-tier
// artifacts are actually provisioned on this machine (a bare CI leg without artifacts
// is a no-op, not a failure).
