// TestArtifacts — one source of truth for "can this machine run a test that needs BC
// artifacts?", and the only sanctioned way to say "it cannot".
//
// Why this file exists
// --------------------
// Twenty-three test classes each declared their own private ArtifactsPresent(), in three
// mutually inconsistent spellings:
//
//   a) `~/.bcartifacts.cache/sandbox` only            — 6 classes
//   b) `~/.local/share/al-runner/artifacts/<ver>` only — 15 classes
//   c) (a) with a fallback to (b)                      — 2 classes
//
// Nothing in this repo ever creates (a). `.github/workflows/test-matrix.yml` provisions
// `~/.local/share/al-runner/artifacts/<version>` (service tier), `~/.al-runner/platform-apps`,
// `~/.al-runner/test-apps` and `~/.cache/al-runner/ncl-cecil` — no `.bcartifacts.cache`
// anywhere. So on CI the six classes in group (a) always took the "environment unavailable"
// branch. It only ever looked provisioned on a dev box with a multi-GB BC sandbox artifact
// cached, which is where each of those gates was written.
//
// The gate drifted unnoticed because it was copied, and the fix was applied per class as
// each copy was noticed rather than centrally. Same reasoning as TestBuildConfig, which
// exists because the build configuration and BC version had drifted apart across suites.
// Hence: one helper, and a drift guard in TestArtifactsGateTests that fails the build if a
// class starts spelling the check itself again.
//
// Why the unavailable branch must THROW
// -------------------------------------
// Those gates were `if (!ArtifactsPresent()) { …; return; }`. An early return from a test
// method is a PASS: xUnit has nothing to distinguish "asserted everything" from "asserted
// nothing", so the run reported `Failed: 0, Passed: 485, Skipped: 0` while a chunk of those
// 485 executed no assertions at all. That is the silent-default anti-pattern from
// .claude/rules/loud-failures.md wearing test clothing — a green tick that means nothing ran.
//
// xUnit v2 has no dynamic skip of its own (Assert.Skip is absent from the shipped
// xunit.assert 2.9.3 surface, and its Xunit.Sdk.SkipException reports Failed because the v2
// execution engine never learned the $XunitDynamicSkip$ token). Xunit.SkippableFact supplies
// it: throw Xunit.SkipException from a [SkippableFact]/[SkippableTheory] and the result is a
// real Skipped, counted in the run summary and attributed with a reason.
//
// So a test that cannot run now says so out loud. And on CI it does not even get to skip:
// see CiMissingArtifactsMessage — a leg where the shared gate itself goes stale would
// otherwise skip everything, visibly and accurately, and still report green.
