// StartupOutputReexecDedupTests — issues #2041 and #2066.
//
// Split out of #2037/#2038: this process's startup reporting (the `[provision] BC ...
// already complete` line, `[bc] selected BC ...`, and the `al-runner — running N
// bundle(s)` banner) is printed BEFORE the shadow-re-exec decision hands off to a child
// process. The tool package no longer ships Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Ncl.dll (#2023/#2026),
// so NclShadowRuntime.NeedsShadow is true on essentially every real invocation, and the
// child re-runs the exact same startup sequence from scratch — reprinting all three
// lines. Confirmed live against the published 2.5.0 package with `strace -f -e
// trace=execve`: exactly two execve calls on a warm run, and all three lines appear
// twice, once per process generation.
//
// #2041's original fix computed whether THIS generation would need to shadow-re-exec — a
// cheap, deterministic filesystem check (does Ncl.dll already exist beside this
// assembly?) known before any of the three lines would print — and suppressed them in
// that generation only. That covered exactly the one re-exec it was written for. #2066
// (published 2.7.0) found a SECOND re-exec that can stack on top — a per-BC-minor
// engine-variant swap, or (the shape this file's tests reproduce deterministically) the
// shadow-hop generation's own first-ever Cecil rewrite landing a cache MISS — which the
// #2041 flag had no way to predict, since it is only knowable after the shadow hop has
// already happened. Program.cs's fix (see its own comments starting at
// `deferredStartupLines`) replaced predict-then-suppress with defer-then-flush: the three
// lines (and the degraded-variant warning) are queued rather than printed immediately,
// and flushed only once a generation clears EVERY re-exec decision point in the
// function — a generation that re-execs further never reaches the flush and its queue is
// simply discarded, so this now generalizes to however many generations stack, not just
// the one #2041 anticipated. The `[reexec]` explanation itself (#2034/#2038) is
// untouched: it still prints unconditionally from whichever generation decides to hand
// off, at default verbosity.
//
// Issue #2061 — shared mutable state between this class's tests, round 2
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Two of this class's tests need a bin/-shaped directory where Ncl.dll is genuinely
// present (NoReexecRun_...) or absent-then-forced (ShadowDoneEnvVarForced_...). Both
// used to run directly against the SHARED AlRunner/bin/<config>/<tfm>/ directory that
// Program.cs itself is built into — the same directory several OTHER test classes in
// this assembly also spawn the real runner against concurrently (see
// NclShadowRuntime.EnsureShadowDir's own doc comment on why its shadow-dir cache key
// folds in a hash of the caller's directory: "AlRunner.Tests's own parallel test
// collections proved this matters").
//
// A first pass at #2061 added a precondition assert (Ncl.dll must be absent before
// NoReexecRun_...'s warmup spawn) plus a loud, retrying cleanup in
// ShadowDoneEnvVarForced_... in place of a swallowed `catch { /* best effort */ }`. Both
// were correct fixes in isolation, but PR #2063's own CI run (BC 27.3 leg) proved they
// were not sufficient: the precondition passed, yet the warmup spawn's OWN re-check of
// the identical path, moments later inside a freshly cold-started subprocess, found
// Ncl.dll already there — and the TRX for that run showed zero wall-clock overlap
// between the two tests, so it was not simple same-class scheduling. The real problem is
// structural: a check here and a re-check inside a separate process launch are two
// different moments in time, against a path this test does not own exclusively — no
// amount of asserting the state at ONE of those moments closes a gap that exists BETWEEN
// them.
//
// So both tests now build their OWN private, uniquely-named mirror of the real build
// output (MirrorOriginalBinDir, reusing NclShadowRuntime.MirrorInstallDirectory — the
// exact mechanism Program.cs's own shadow-dir builder uses: dependency DLLs symlinked,
// the entry assembly and its manifests real-copied) and run every remaining step against
// that private copy. Once mirrored, nothing else in the process — no sibling test, no
// concurrently-running test class, no subprocess this test itself spawns — can ever
// observe or mutate the path this test cares about, which removes the shared-state
// hazard structurally rather than narrowing the window around it.
