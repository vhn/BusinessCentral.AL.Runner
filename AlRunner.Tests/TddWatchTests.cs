/// Issue #2002 (follow-up to #1997): --tdd must work together with --watch, not be
/// rejected outright. This is the proving test the issue's own acceptance criteria
/// describe: cycle 1 (a test calls a not-yet-implemented procedure) reports FAILED;
/// a LATER cycle, after the missing procedure is implemented and the file saved —
/// WITHOUT restarting the watch process — reports the same test PASSED.
///
/// Written and first verified against #2000's refuse-only --tdd (every missing
/// symbol reported failed, nothing generated). #2005 landed member GENERATION while
/// this PR was in flight (--tdd now infers and generates a stub for a resolvable
/// missing symbol, per #2001) — rebasing onto it changed the fixture's behaviour, so
/// this file was reworked. Two things are worth recording because they are not what
/// the PR's own original design comment predicted:
///
/// 1. DoubleIt (this fixture's originally-missing procedure) is now a RESOLVABLE case
///    per #2001's inference rules: --tdd generates a stub for it rather than excluding
///    it. Cycle 1 therefore reports FAILED via Program.cs's OverrideTddDependentResults
///    ("this test depends on N generated member(s)..."), not TddSupport's refuse-path
///    message.
/// 2. TddWatchRefusedTests.Codeunit.al (added alongside the original fixture) closes
///    that gap cleanly: its bare-statement call to DoThing has no type anchor, so
///    --tdd's generation REFUSES it (TddGeneration.cs) rather than guessing, and that
///    object is excluded from EVERY compile — DoThing is deliberately never
///    implemented anywhere in this fixture. The fork's sole incremental engine,
///    RadWorkspace, never commits an incomplete compiler picture as a delta baseline.
///    It loads the surviving assembly for the current cycle, then performs another full
///    compile on the next edit. That is what lets this test prove both recovery and the
///    safety diagnostic without retaining the retired second incremental pipeline.
///
/// Spawns the real runner; needs the BC artifact cache. Skips (no-op) when absent.
/// See DefineFlagIntegrationTests for why runner-subprocess tests used to be
/// [Collection("server-serial")] and no longer are — #1809.
